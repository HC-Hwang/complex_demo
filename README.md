plotly can be installed through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly):

To run the tutorial, you may want to install [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

Why not use matplotlib? from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Installation

Clone? Or download the package?

# How to run the tutorial?

We provide a tutorial using Jupyter notebook. However, the plotly module cannot display on Github. We recommend one to download the entire package and then run the notebook.

```
jupyter notebook
```

# Use the package in Jupyter Notebook
 
# Use the package in your code...
