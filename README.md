# complex_demo

Hi all. complex_demo is a package originally designed for the class "Fourier Optics" at Johns Hopkins University. This package aims to visualize the properties of Fourier transform. It can also be used as a simplied 3D python module.

# Package dependence
Python 2.7 or Python >3.5

numpy >1.14.0

plotly >2.0.12

Ipython >5.5.0

plotly can be installed through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly):
```
conda install -c plotly plotly
```
or through [pip](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started):
```
pip install plotly 
```

To run the tutorial, you may want to install [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

It is important to update your Jupyter notebook because there is an [known issue](https://community.plot.ly/t/offline-mode-in-jupyter-notebook-shows-blank-graphs/1860/7) running plotly in an older version of Jupyter notebook.

Why not use matplotlib? from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D


# How to run the tutorial?

We provide a Jupyter notebook tutorial. However, the plots generated by plotly cannot display on Github. We recommend one to download the entire package and then run the notebook.

```
jupyter notebook
```
# Find a bug!? 

The package is still under developing and testing. If you find a bug, or bugs, or have any suggestions, feel free to contact us!
