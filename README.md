Hi All.
# Package dependence
numpy
plotly

Why not use matplotlib? from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# How to run the tutorial?

We provide a tutorial using Jupyter notebook. However, the plotly module cannot display on Github. We recommend one to download the entire package and then run the notebook.

# Use the package in Jupyter Notebook
 
# Use the package in your code...
